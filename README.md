# Hi, I'm Kris.

My name is Kristofer Selbekk, and I'm a 27 year old **software engineer** from Oslo, Norway. 

## This is my resume.
 
You can [read it as Markdown](RESUME.md), or [browse it as a website](http://www.kristoferselbekk.com/resume).

I'm currently developing this, so please hang on for a few hours.

## I'm moving to San Francisco!

The reason for this resume even being created is because I'm planning on relocating to San Francisco, California. I used 
to live there a few years ago (as an exchange student), and I finally convinced myself to return.

## I'm currently working for [Bekk Consulting](http://bekk.no/en/)!

Bekk is an amazing employer, and I'm incredibly lucky to have worked with these incredibly talented people. 
Unfortunately, this premier Norweigan consultancy firm doesn't have any offices where I'm heading - and that's why I'm 
writing this resume.  

## I'm looking for positions in the Bay Area

Since my beautiful and talented girlfriend has been accepted to UC Berkeley, I'm looking for a place to work somewhere 
close by.
